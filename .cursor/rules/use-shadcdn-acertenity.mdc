# Guideline for UI Component Creation

## Prioritize shadcdn/ui and Acertenity UI

When a request involves creating or suggesting UI components, always consider and, where appropriate, prioritize using components from the **shadcdn/ui** and **Acertenity UI** libraries.

### Rationale:
These libraries are the preferred choice in this project for building user interfaces because they offer:
*   A comprehensive set of pre-built and customizable components.
*   Consistency in design and user experience.
*   Improved development speed and efficiency.

### Action:
Before suggesting custom component solutions or other libraries, evaluate if the required functionality can be achieved using shadcdn/ui or Acertenity UI. If components from these libraries are suitable, they should be the primary recommendation.
