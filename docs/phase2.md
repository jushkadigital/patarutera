# Phase 2: Architecture & Backend Integration

This phase focuses on implementing the core architectural decisions and integrating PayloadCMS as the headless backend for content management.

## 2.1. Architectural Decisions Implementation

- [ ] **Implement Next.js 15 Frontend Application Structure:**
  - Establish the defined directory structure (e.g., for `components`, `blocks`, `lib`).
  - Set up foundational layout components.

- [ ] **Configure PayloadCMS Collections and Fields:**
  - Define initial collections in PayloadCMS (e.g., Pages, Tours, Blog Posts).
  - Specify the fields for each collection (e.g., title, slug, content, custom fields).
  - Ensure these collections can serve as the headless backend for the Next.js frontend.

- [ ] **Define and Document API Communication Strategy:**
  - Decide on the primary communication method (GraphQL or REST API) for fetching data from PayloadCMS.
  - Document the key endpoints or queries that the Next.js application will use.
  - Outline data fetching patterns and error handling.

## 2.2. PayloadCMS Configuration for Content Blocks

- [ ] **Configure PayloadCMS for Dynamic Content:**
  - Ensure PayloadCMS is set up to manage all dynamic site content as planned (Pages, Tours, Blog Posts, reusable blocks, etc.).

- [ ] **Define "Content Block" Types in PayloadCMS:**
  - Create specific "Block" types within PayloadCMS (e.g., Hero, TextBlock, FeatureGrid, TestimonialSlider, ImageGallery, VideoEmbed).
  - For each block type, define the necessary fields (e.g., title, text, image, button URL, settings).
  - Consider variations and reusability of these blocks.

- [ ] **Plan Content Editor Workflow for Assembling Pages:**
  - Outline how content editors will use the defined blocks in PayloadCMS to build and structure pages.
  - Ensure the CMS interface is intuitive for block management and page assembly.

## Next Steps

Upon successful completion of Phase 2, the project will have a functional backend content structure and a clear API communication path. The frontend application structure will be in place, ready for dynamic content rendering. The subsequent phase will focus on building out the frontend routing and dynamic page implementation based on the CMS data.
