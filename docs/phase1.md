# Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Technologies

## 1.1. Core Objective Alignment

The core objective of this project is to develop a performant, maintainable Travel Agency website with a dynamic content structure managed by a headless CMS, leveraging modern web technologies.

### Key Goals
- Develop a performant and responsive website for showcasing tours, publishing blog posts, and providing information
- Implement a flexible content structure capable of handling various page types (general content, tours, and blog posts) using a dynamic routing approach
- Utilize modern styling and component libraries (Shadcn UI and Aceternity UI) for a consistent, appealing, and interactive user interface
- Build with a focus on maintainability and developer experience

### Success Criteria
- Team understands and agrees on the project objectives
- Clear understanding of the scope, including what is excluded
- Alignment on the architectural approach using dynamic routes and content blocks

## 1.2. Technology Stack Setup

### Next.js 15 Project Setup
- Initialize a new Next.js 15 project with App Router
- Configure the basic project structure following Next.js conventions
- Set up the dynamic route structure (`app/[slug]/page.tsx`) as the foundation

### Tailwind CSS v4 Integration
- Install and configure Tailwind CSS v4
- Set up the basic configuration file
- Define any custom theme settings (colors, fonts, etc.)

### UI Component Libraries
- Install and configure Shadcn UI for foundational UI elements
- Set up Aceternity UI for complex/interactive components
- Create a basic component structure to organize both libraries

### TypeScript Configuration
- Ensure TypeScript is properly configured
- Set up appropriate tsconfig.json settings
- Establish type definitions for key structures (pages, blocks, etc.)

### PayloadCMS Setup
- Install and configure a development instance of PayloadCMS
- Set up initial content models and schemas
- Configure basic API endpoints for frontend consumption

### Version Control Setup
- Initialize Git repository
- Define and document branching strategy
- Set up .gitignore with appropriate exclusions
- Create initial commit with base project structure

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Project repository created and initialized
- [ ] Next.js 15 with App Router installed and configured
- [ ] Tailwind CSS v4 integrated
- [ ] Shadcn UI components available
- [ ] Aceternity UI components available
- [ ] TypeScript configured correctly
- [ ] PayloadCMS development instance running
- [ ] Git workflow established

## Next Steps
Upon completion of Phase 1, the project will have a solid foundation with all the necessary technologies in place. The team will then proceed to Phase 2: Architecture & Backend Integration, focusing on implementing the architectural decisions and configuring PayloadCMS for content blocks.
