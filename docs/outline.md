# Implementation Checklist

This checklist outlines the key tasks for developing the [Project Name] Travel Agency website, based on the defined project architecture.

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Technologies

### 1.1. Core Objective Alignment
- [ ] Confirm team understanding of the core objective: To develop a performant, maintainable Travel Agency website with a dynamic content structure managed by a headless CMS, leveraging modern web technologies.

### 1.2. Technology Stack Setup
- [ ] Setup Next.js 15 project with App Router.
- [ ] Configure Tailwind CSS v4 integration.
- [ ] Integrate Shadcn UI for foundational UI elements.
- [ ] Integrate Aceternity UI for complex/interactive components.
- [ ] Establish and configure TypeScript for the project.
- [ ] Setup and configure a development instance of PayloadCMS.
- [ ] Initialize Git repository and define branching strategy.

## Phase 2: Architecture & Backend Integration

### 2.1. Architectural Decisions Implementation
- [ ] Implement Next.js 15 frontend application structure.
- [ ] Configure PayloadCMS collections and fields to serve as the headless backend.
- [ ] Define and document the API communication strategy (e.g., GraphQL endpoints, REST API routes) between Next.js and PayloadCMS.

### 2.2. PayloadCMS Configuration for Content Blocks
- [ ] Configure PayloadCMS to manage all dynamic site content (Pages, Tours, Blog Posts, etc.).
- [ ] Define "Content Block" types within PayloadCMS (e.g., Hero, TextBlock, FeatureGrid, TestimonialSlider) with appropriate fields.
- [ ] Plan for how content editors will assemble pages using these blocks in PayloadCMS.

## Phase 3: Frontend Development - Structure & Routing

### 3.1. Next.js App Router & Core Structure
- [ ] Implement dynamic routing using `app/[slug]/page.tsx` to handle various content types.
- [ ] Create the root layout component (`app/layout.tsx`).
- [ ] Establish frontend directory structure:
    - [ ] `app/` for core routing and pages.
    - [ ] `components/ui/` for Shadcn UI based components.
    - [ ] `components/aceternity/` for Aceternity UI based components.
    - [ ] `blocks/` for page section components corresponding to PayloadCMS blocks.
    - [ ] `lib/` for utility functions, data fetching logic, and CMS interaction helpers.
- [ ] Configure global styles in `globals.css`, including Tailwind CSS directives and base styles.

### 3.2. Dynamic Page Implementation (`app/[slug]/page.tsx`)
- [ ] Implement slug extraction from URL parameters.
- [ ] Develop data fetching logic to retrieve page-specific data and content blocks from PayloadCMS based on the slug.
- [ ] Implement dynamic rendering logic to map over the fetched blocks data and render the corresponding React block components.

## Phase 4: Frontend Development - Components & Blocks

### 4.1. Base Component Development
- [ ] Develop/customize base UI elements using Shadcn UI and Tailwind CSS (e.g., buttons, inputs, cards).
- [ ] Develop/integrate complex and interactive UI components using Aceternity UI.

### 4.2. "Block" Component Development
- [ ] For each "Content Block" type defined in PayloadCMS, create a corresponding React component in the `/blocks` directory (e.g., `HeroBlock.tsx`, `FeatureGridBlock.tsx`).
- [ ] Ensure block components correctly receive and utilize data passed from `app/[slug]/page.tsx`.
- [ ] Style block components using Tailwind CSS, composing elements from Shadcn UI and Aceternity UI as needed.

## Phase 5: State Management & Data Flow

### 5.1. Data Fetching & Server State
- [ ] Implement robust server state management for data fetched from PayloadCMS (using Next.js built-in `fetch` or a library like React Query/SWR).
- [ ] Ensure efficient and optimized data fetching patterns.

### 5.2. Client-Side State
- [ ] Define and implement a strategy for client-side state management (start with local component state, consider React Context or Zustand only if necessary for complex shared state).

## Phase 6: Testing, Refinement & Documentation
- [ ] Implement unit tests for critical components and logic.
- [ ] Conduct thorough cross-browser and responsive design testing.
- [ ] Code review and refactoring for quality and maintainability.
- [ ] Update/create necessary project documentation (README, component docs, etc.).

## Phase 7: Future Considerations (Post-MVP Planning)
- [ ] Plan for Internationalization (i18n) strategy with PayloadCMS and Next.js.
- [ ] Explore potential for Personalization features.
- [ ] Consider requirements and implementation for A/B Testing capabilities.
