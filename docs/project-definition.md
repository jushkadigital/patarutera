# Project Definition: [Project Name]

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the definition for the development of the Travel Agency website. The project will leverage the latest web technologies, including Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS v4, Shadcn UI, and Aceternity UI, to create a fast, modern, and maintainable platform with rich and interactive components.

## 2. Project Goals

* To develop a performant and responsive website for [briefly describe the website's purpose, e.g., showcasing tours, publishing blog posts, providing information].
* To implement a flexible content structure capable of handling various page types, including general content, tours, and blog posts, using a dynamic routing approach.
* To utilize modern styling and a combination of component libraries (Shadcn UI and Aceternity UI) for a consistent, appealing, and interactive user interface.
* To build the project with a focus on maintainability and developer experience.

## 3. Scope

The scope of this project includes:

* Development of the frontend using Next.js 15 and the App Router.
* Implementation of styling using Tailwind CSS v4.
* Integration and utilization of Shadcn UI for base components.
* Integration and utilization of Aceternity UI for more complex and interactive components.
* Creation of a dynamic route structure (`app/[slug]/page.tsx`) to handle:
    * General content pages (e.g., About Us, Contact).
    * Individual Tour pages.
    * Individual Blog Post pages.
* Logic within `app/[slug]/page.tsx` to determine the type of content based on the `slug` and render the appropriate layout and components.
* Basic data fetching mechanisms for retrieving content for general pages, tours, and blog posts (specific data source/API is assumed to be defined elsewhere).
* Implementation of a responsive design for various devices.

The scope **excludes** (unless explicitly mentioned elsewhere):

* Development of a backend or API (consumption of data is within scope).
* Content creation (text, images, videos).
* Advanced features such as user authentication, e-commerce functionality, complex search, multilingual support beyond the core development language being English, etc. (unless specified).
* Deployment and hosting infrastructure setup (deployment process may be documented separately).
* Extensive custom component development outside of using, customizing, and composing Shadcn UI and Aceternity UI components.

## 4. Technology Stack

* **Framework:** Next.js 15 (with App Router)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4
* **Component Libraries:** Shadcn UI, Aceternity UI
* **Language:** TypeScript (recommended for better maintainability, though not strictly required by the prompt)
* **Package Manager:** pnpm, yarn, or npm (to be decided)

## 5. Architecture and Structure

The project will follow the Next.js App Router conventions. The core of the dynamic content handling will reside in the `app/[slug]/page.tsx` file.
app/
├── [slug]/
│   └── page.tsx       # Handles general pages, tours, and blog posts based on slug
├── layout.tsx         # Root layout
├── globals.css        # Global styles, including Tailwind directives
└── ...                 # Other potential routes or files (e.g., app/api, app/ui)

Within `app/[slug]/page.tsx`, logic will be implemented to:

1.  Extract the `slug` from the URL parameters.
2.  Determine the type of content (general page, tour, or blog post) based on the `slug` or potentially by fetching data related to the slug.
3.  Fetch the relevant data for the content type.
4.  Render the appropriate React components and layout for the specific content type, utilizing a combination of Shadcn UI and Aceternity UI components, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

Specific directories or components for tours and blog posts, potentially integrating components from both libraries, will be organized logically, perhaps within a `components` or `features` directory, and imported into `app/[slug]/page.tsx`.

## 6. Design and User Interface

* The design will be implemented using Tailwind CSS v4 utility classes.
* Shadcn UI components will be used as the foundation for standard UI elements, customized as needed with Tailwind.
* Aceternity UI components will be integrated for more specific, visually rich, and interactive sections or elements as required by the design.
* The website will be fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.

## 7. Development and Collaboration

* Development will be managed using Git for version control.
* A standard branching strategy (e.g., Gitflow or GitHub flow) will be followed.
* Code reviews will be conducted for all changes.
* Issues and tasks will be tracked using a project management tool (to be specified).
* Communication will primarily be in English within code, documentation, and project management tools.

## 8. Future Considerations

* Integration with a Content Management System (CMS) for easier content management of general pages, tours, and blog posts.
* Implementation of more advanced search and filtering for tours and blog posts.
* Performance optimizations (e.g., image optimization, code splitting) beyond the standard Next.js capabilities.
* Exploration of additional interactive components from Aceternity UI or other libraries as needed.

## 9. Definition of Done

* All features outlined in the scope are implemented and tested.
* The website is responsive and functions correctly on target devices and browsers.
* Code is clean, well-commented, and follows established coding standards.
* Project documentation (this definition, technical documentation) is up-to-date.
* The project is ready for deployment to a staging or production environment.
